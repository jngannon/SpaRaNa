# SparaNa

This is a library for training sparse neural networks. Called Sparana, short for sparse parameter analysis. It is only intended for me to do experiments on, I will add features as I need them, and when I have time. At this stage it is very limited, for example, I use ReLu activations, so I have not implemented layers that use sigmoid activations. It is in its very early stages, some things will not be optimized. Some features may be a part of experiments that did not work out, and do nothing of value. 

I am happy for anyone else to use this software, or more likely get some ideas and implement them in their own software. I will keep updating this library and one day it will be useful to anyone else who wants to train sparse neural networks. 

This library uses Numpy and CuPy(for GPU operations). 

The Demo-Model notebook demonstrates how to build and train a simple model.

More notebooks will be coming soon to demonstrate other things that the library can do.
